## Overview & Purpose   
For thsi project, my goal was to create queries that could pull processed (basic statistical calculations) weather information from our sqlite file to be further analyzed to find trends. These trends will be used to make predictions to see if a surf and ice cream business could operate year round.    
## Results   
![June](https://github.com/ajsadowy/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Data_Figures/June.png)
![December](https://github.com/ajsadowy/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Data_Figures/December.png)    
### 3 Key Differences Between June and December   
* The temperature range is almost the same, December does the lowest point at 56 degrees while June's lowest is 64 degrees.   
* Percepitation for both months are close to being the same, the exception being December having a maximum percipitation at 6.42 while June has a max percipitation of 4.43.
* Being these two data sets are 6 months apart, the hypothesis of the weather for this location in Hawaii is consistent year round.

## Summary & Suggestions  
![March](https://github.com/ajsadowy/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Data_Figures/March.png)
![September](https://github.com/ajsadowy/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Data_Figures/September.png)   
With the hypothesis of the weather patterns being similar year round, I tested that hypothesis by conducting two additional queries for the months of March and September. These two months being inbetween June and December, if they have similar percipitation and temperature then there is more support for the claim the weather being consistant year round. Seeing the precipatation being near 5.9 and temperature in the 80s the claim seems to hold.
